## Functionality of the App
In this app you can visualize personal data as a list of cards.
Features:
- When the user types in the search bar, the list of cards is filtered in order to show only the cards having a matching username. When a search is performed, the list pagination resets to the first page.
- For each user the following data is shown: name, address, country and  website url.
- The country calculated by reverse geocoding the provided latitude and longitude, using Nominatim OpenStreetMap. 
- Search state is managed with Redux

Enjoy! üçª 
This app is designed to be responsive, you can swipe the user's card to have a complete view of everything.

### Next steps

- Display an empty card state instead of a loading emoji
- Jest tests
- Automatically load the next page when the last card is swiped when in mobile mode

### Troubleshooting
Nominatim is rate limited, and it might refuse to perform a reverse geocoding operation. In this case the error is handled by showing a message inviting the user to reload the page and retry.### Thanks to

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
